                <li>
                    <strong>Bot Usage:</strong> OpenGuard is provided "as is" for moderation and analytics purposes. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service or error-free operation.

                <li>
                    <strong>Data Storage:</strong> Moderation logs, infractions, appeals, and server configuration data are stored securely for the purpose of providing bot and dashboard functionality.

                    <strong>Prohibited Use:</strong> You may not use OpenGuard for illegal activities, harassment, or to circumvent Discord's rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> We are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use or inability to use OpenGuard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Changes:</strong> We may update these terms at any time. Continued use of OpenGuard constitutes acceptance of any changes.
