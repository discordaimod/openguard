This repo uses yarn with workspaces in website/ and dashboard/frontend/.

Test the website and dashboard with `yarn test`, `yarn lint`, and `yarn build` from the project root.
If these scripts are being stubborn you may have to cd into the individual workspaces and run the commands there.

Test python with `pytest` and `pyright`.
